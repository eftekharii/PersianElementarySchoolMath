# How to contribute #

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project.  There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

*IMPORTANT: 0.Add your user info to CONTRIBUTORS file.*
1. All assets are organized into the assetes directory by their grade. (ex: /assets/4th)
2. Each contributor can finalize ther css file by the username they put in CONTRIBUTORS file. (ex: /assets/4th/css/jimist.css)
3. If you wish to use sass instead of css, create a sass file by your username and a directory by its side (ex: jimist.sass and sass/jimsit/*.sass). You can import your sass files from your own directory or other co-contributors (files like general, header, footer and etc.). 
4. Images are saved without background in the images directory. If you wanted to add one use this approach as well.
5. Fonts are stored in /assets/fonts/ directory. For example of their usage look at other styles.
6. You can use softwares like Prepros for compiling your sass file into css. Other tools like gulp or webpack should not pushed to the repository.
